# gocmpp
An implementation of China Mobile Peer to Peer(cmpp) protocol in golang for both client and server sides.

The protocol versions below are coveredï¼š
* [cmpp2.1](http://pan.baidu.com/s/13E0Q6)
* [cmpp3.0](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1o61obA6)

## Overview
gocmpp is a library that implements China Mobile Peer to Peer(cmpp) protocol. You can use the lib to implement any app, tool or system that use cmpp protocol for both client and server side.

gocmpp is portable well. It can be used on linux, darwin or even windows.

gocmpp has covered cmpp2.x and cmpp3.x versions. It has supported the connect, submit, deliver, fwd, active test, and terminate packets of cmpp protocol. But other less use packets like cmpp query, cancel and route have not been supported. And they are not in the roadmap at all.

## QuickStart

### 1. Download gocmpp
```
$go get github.com/bigwhite/gocmpp
```

### 2. Build gocmpp

gocmpp's build use the vendor mechanism introduced in go 1.5, so we need go 1.5 or later version to build it.

```
$export GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT="1"
$cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/bigwhite/gocmpp
$make
$make
go build -o examples/server/server examples/server/server.go
go build -o examples/client/client examples/client/client.go
go build
go build ./utils
go test
PASS
ok  	github.com/bigwhite/gocmpp	0.009s
go test ./utils
ok  	github.com/bigwhite/gocmpp/utils	0.008s
```

### 3. Run the examples

run the two programs below in order:
 * ./examples/server/server
 * ./examples/client/client

you would get the output like below:

server:

```
### 4.How to use the library
The best start entry is the code in folder '[examples](https://github.com/bigwhite/gocmpp/tree/master/examples)'. 
 * client.go tells you how to use gocmpp in client side.
 * server.go presents you how to construct a cmpp server in gocmpp.
